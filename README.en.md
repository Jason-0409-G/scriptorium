# research-to-paper

> English ｜ [中文](README.md)

Producing a research manuscript spans a series of loosely coupled, individually error-prone stages: fixing the
angle of attack, retrieving the literature and verifying that every citation is real and correctly attributed,
drafting in proportion to the strength of the evidence, pruning over-claims through independent review, governing
readability and the detectable traces of machine authorship, and finally typesetting to a submission format. These
stages are usually handled by a scatter of single-purpose tools or by hand, and the seams between them are where
things break — a mis-attributed DOI, a sentence that runs ahead of its evidence, a paragraph whose uniform cadence
reads as machine-written — any one of which can cost a manuscript its credibility at review.

**research-to-paper consolidates this chain into a single, fully self-contained skill.** As one plugin, it carries
a research idea systematically through all of the stages above while keeping the author in the decision loop
throughout. Its design rests on three principles. **Rigor** — every reference's DOI is checked one by one against
CrossRef, wording is matched to the strength of the evidence (a model or single gene may only *predict*; a measured
whole-system result may *confirm*), and the draft is cross-examined by several mutually independent reviewer agents.
**Self-containment** — search, verification, review, drafting, de-AI, and typesetting are all built in; it depends
on no external skill, so installing this one plugin gives you the whole pipeline. **Auditability** — every writing
judgment and every de-AI edit leaves a traceable record matrix rather than a black-box output.

The full pipeline runs: **research idea → fix the direction (including the target journal and its author
requirements) → build a verified reference library → draft → multi-round adversarial review → de-AI (with long-short
sentence variation) → render LaTeX / Word / PDF**; each stage can also be invoked on its own.

Works in **Claude Code** and **Codex**.

## Install

### Claude Code

**Option 1 · Plugin marketplace (recommended)**

```
/plugin marketplace add Jason-0409-G/research-to-paper
/plugin install research-to-paper@research-to-paper
/reload-plugins
```

**Option 2 · Script (clone, then install locally)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jason-0409-G/research-to-paper.git
cd research-to-paper
bash install.sh claude          # macOS / Linux
# Windows PowerShell:  .\install.ps1 -Target claude
```
Restart Claude Code, then just ask it to "follow the research-to-paper workflow".

### Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jason-0409-G/research-to-paper.git
cd research-to-paper
bash install.sh codex           # macOS / Linux
# Windows PowerShell:  .\install.ps1 -Target codex
```
The script copies the seven skills into `~/.codex/skills/` (Claude Code uses `~/.claude/skills/`). Restart Codex to
use them. `bash install.sh all` installs to both at once.

## What each sub-skill does

| Sub-skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **research-to-paper** | Orchestrator. Detects which stage you're at and routes the request through **scope → curate → write → build** as needed; each stage is also usable on its own. |
| **research-to-paper-scope** | **Decide the direction.** Reads authoritative literature first to understand the field, then confirms — one question at a time — the angle, scope, **target journal**, **word count**, and core themes; once the journal is set it **looks up that journal's author requirements** online (aims & scope, article types, length, structure, citation style). Produces `scope_brief.md`. |
| **research-to-paper-curate** | **Build the library + resource search.** Five-source literature search (OpenAlex / Europe PMC / PubMed / Semantic Scholar / Crossref) → per-paper **CrossRef DOI verification** (catching dead DOIs *and* DOIs that resolve to the wrong paper, recovering the correct one) → **multi-agent adversarial review** that rejects fabricated or mis-attributed references → **direct import into Zotero by category when a Zotero API key is set**, otherwise export **RIS (Zotero/EndNote) + BibTeX + a by-category, color-coded Excel**. Also searches biology **resource** databases: any NCBI Entrez db (protein / nucleotide / gene / taxonomy / assembly / structure / SRA …) plus UniProt / RCSB PDB / AlphaFold / Europe PMC. |
| **research-to-paper-write** | **Draft.** Understands the content first and restates the core argument with you, plans a **per-unit rationale matrix** (not a generic IMRaD template), and drafts with **evidence-matched hedging** (a model/gene only "predicts"; a measured whole-system result may "confirm"). Orchestrates the audit and humanize passes. Scenes: review / report / paper. |
| **research-to-paper-audit** | **Multi-round adversarial review.** Spawns **three independent reviewer agents** (claim-support / logic & structure / citation integrity) plus an Editor Synthesis, and re-runs **until a round is clean**. Catches over-claims, unsupported claims, interpretation leaking into Results, shallow edits, and citations that don't support their sentence. Usable standalone ("review this draft"). |
| **research-to-paper-humanize** | **De-AI.** Reworks prose along **five dimensions**: **D1 sentence length (long–short variation)**, D2 paragraph-structure variety, D3 information-density alternation, D4 connector control (removing AI-frequent connectors), D5 term-context variation — at a light/medium/heavy tier, recording every change in `humanize_matrix.md` and verifying with `humanize_check.py`. Usable standalone ("de-AI this paragraph"). |
| **research-to-paper-build** | **Render formats.** Uses pandoc to turn the finished manuscript into **LaTeX (.tex) / Word (.docx) / PDF**, resolving `[@key]` citations from `library.bib` into a reference list. |

Each piece **triggers on its own**: "verify these DOIs", "de-AI this paragraph", "audit my draft", "export to Word"
all hit the right sub-skill directly.

## Dependencies

Everything is Python **stdlib** except these optional tools (each step degrades gracefully or tells you what to
install):

- **`openpyxl`** (Python) — for the styled `.xlsx`; without it, curate writes a `.csv` instead (RIS/BibTeX unaffected).
- **`pandoc`** — required by `research-to-paper-build` for LaTeX/Word output (`brew install pandoc` / `apt install pandoc` / winget on Windows).
- **A TeX engine** (xelatex/pdflatex) — only for PDF; without it you still get the `.tex` to compile elsewhere.
- **API credentials (all optional)** — copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or `~/.config/research-to-paper/keys.env`): `CROSSREF_MAILTO` / `NCBI_EMAIL` join the faster polite pool; `NCBI_API_KEY` / `S2_API_KEY` raise rate limits; `ZOTERO_API_KEY` + `ZOTERO_USER_ID` enable **direct categorized import into Zotero** (EndNote has no public write API, so it stays a `.ris` import). `.env` is gitignored; everything works with no key at all.

## Usage

Just ask, for example:

- "I have a research direction but haven't fixed the angle yet — scope it, build a verified library, then write it as a review."
- "Verify the DOIs in these references, drop the fake ones, and give me a RIS for EndNote."
- "De-AI this paragraph, vary the sentence length." / "Audit this draft for over-claims."
- "Export this manuscript to LaTeX and Word."

The orchestrator runs only the stages you need and tells you what each produced before moving on.
